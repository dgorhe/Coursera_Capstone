    "For this project, I wanted to compare the coffee scene in four US cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York. The purpose of this is to understand which cities high competition among coffee shops and where would be a good place to invest in more coffee shops. If I was a big coffee chain and I wanted to determine where to open more coffee shops, this data would be useful in determining where to open new storefronts among these cities. Of course this could be extended to more cities but for this project, we'll limit it to these 4 cities. \n",

    "### A.2 Data Used\n",
    "I will be using the following data from each city for my analysis:\n",
    "* Absolute number of coffee shops \n",
    "* Average number of hours the shops are open\n",
    "* Median number of hours the shops are open\n",
    "* Standard deviation in coffee shop hours \n",
